Polyhedra can be described in 2 different ways.

1. H-representation: As the intersection of finitely many halfspaces given by its facets.
2. V-representation: As the convex hull of its vertices + the conic hull of its rays where '+' is the Minkowski sum.

In ``Polyhedra.jl``, those representations are given the respective abstract types ``HRepresentation`` and ``VRepresentation`` which are themself subtypes of ``Representation``.

For instance, consider the 2-dimensional polyhedron described by the following H-representation:

.. math::

   x_1 + x_2 &\leq 1 \\
   x_1 - x_2 &\leq 0 \\
   x_1 & \geq 0.

This set of inequalities can be written in the matrix form :math:`Ax \leq b` where

.. math::

   A = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & -1\\-1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, b = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}.

Let's create this H-representation using the concrete subtype ``SimpleHRepresentation`` of the abstract type ``HRepresentation``.::

    julia> using Polyhedra
    julia> A = [1 1;1 -1;-1 0]
    julia> b = [1,0,0]
    julia> hrep = SimpleHRepresentation(A, b)
    julia> typeof(hrep)
    Polyhedra.SimpleHRepresentation{2,Int64}

This polyhedron has three vertices: :math:`(0,0)`, :math:`(0,1)` and :math:`(0.5,0.5)`.
We can create this V-representation using the concrete subtype ``SimpleVRepresentation`` of the abstract type ``VRepresentation``.
Because :math:`0.5` is fractional, have two choices: either use exact rational arithemtic::

    julia> V = [0 0; 0 1; 1//2 1//2]
    julia> vrep = SimpleVRepresentation(V)
    julia> typeof(vrep)
    Polyhedra.SimpleVRepresentation{2,Rational{Int64}}

or use floating point arithmetic::

    julia> Vf = [0 0; 0 1; 1/2 1/2]
    julia> vrepf = SimpleVRepresentation(Vf)
    julia> typeof(vrepf)
    Polyhedra.SimpleVRepresentation{2,Float64}
